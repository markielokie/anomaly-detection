### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

+ *compas-scores-two-years.csv*: The original COMPAS data that was obtained from [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/compas-recidivism-risk-score-data-and-analysis).
