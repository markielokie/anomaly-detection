+ **Project summary**: This project seeks to use the anomaly detection (seasonal ESD) functions from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nachonavarro/seasonal-esd-anomaly-detection) by Nacho Navarro, which is the Python code of the technique that [Jordan Hochenbaum, Owen S. Vallis and Arun Kejariwa](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.07706.pdf) at Twitter Inc. have created. We attempt to use the seasonal ESD function to flag out anomalies in the human heartrate, leading to better detection and timely prevention of a heart attack.

+ **Technologies used**: Python
